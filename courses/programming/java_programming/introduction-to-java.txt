# What is Java?

Java is a **high-level, object-oriented programming language** that is widely used to build different types of software applications.

### Definition

Java allows developers to write programs that are **platform-independent**.
That means:

👉 **Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)**
Once you compile your Java program, you can run it on any system that supports Java **without rewriting the code**. ([Wikipedia][1])

### Where Java is Used?

Java is used in:

* Desktop Applications
* Web Applications
* Enterprise Applications
* Mobile Apps (**Android**)
* Server-side Applications
* Large Scale Systems

([Wikipedia][1])

### Who Developed Java?

* Java was developed by **Sun Microsystems**
* Java was released in **1995**
* **James Gosling** is known as the **Father of Java** ([Wikipedia][1])
* Later, Sun Microsystems was acquired by **Oracle Corporation (2010)** ([Wikipedia][2])

# History of Java

### 🔥 Origin (1991)

Java started in **1991** as a project at Sun Microsystems, led by:

* James Gosling
* Mike Sheridan
* Patrick Naughton

Initially it was meant for:
embedded devices / interactive television ([Wikipedia][1])

### Name Journey

Java’s project name changed over time:

1. **Oak** (named after an oak tree)
2. **Green**
3. **Java** (inspired by Java coffee) ([Wikipedia][1])

### First Public Release

* Java’s first public release was **Java 1.0 (1996)**
* It introduced the concept of:
  **Bytecode + JVM** for platform independence ([Wikipedia][1])

### Oracle Takes Over (2010)

In **2010**, Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems and became responsible for Java’s development and future. ([Wikipedia][2])

# Key Features of Java

Java was designed with major goals such as:
portability, simplicity, robustness, security, and versatility.

---

## 1. Object-Oriented

Java is **object-oriented**, meaning it is based on:

* **Classes**
* **Objects**
* **Encapsulation**
* **Inheritance**
* **Polymorphism**

Benefits:

* Code becomes modular
* Reusable
* Easy to maintain

---

## 2. Platform Independent (Bytecode + JVM)

Java code works like this:

Java Code (.java) → compiled into **Bytecode (.class)**
Bytecode runs on **JVM** in any OS

This makes Java platform-independent and supports:

👉 **Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)** ([Wikipedia][1])

---

## 3. Simple & Familiar Syntax

Java syntax is inspired from **C/C++**, but:
Java avoids complex low-level features like explicit pointers
So it is easier to learn and safer. ([Wikipedia][1])

---

## 4. Robustness

Java is robust because it provides:

* Strong type checking
* Exception handling
* Automatic Garbage Collection
* Compile-time + Runtime error checking

This reduces common bugs like memory leaks.

---

## 5. Security

Java runs inside JVM, which provides a secure runtime environment and restrictions like:

* Network access limitations
* File system restrictions

This makes Java applications safer, especially on networks. ([Wikipedia][1])

---

## 6. Multithreading & Concurrency

Java supports multithreading, meaning:
It can run multiple tasks simultaneously using threads.

Example uses:

* Gaming
* Server requests handling
* Background processing
* Real-time apps

---

## 7. Rich Standard Library (API)

Java provides huge built-in libraries for:

* Collections (List, Set, Map)
* File Handling (I/O)
* Networking
* Database connectivity (JDBC)
* GUI tools (Swing, JavaFX)
* Concurrency utilities

So developers don’t need to build everything from scratch.

---

## 8. Versatile & Dynamic

Java can be used everywhere:

* Desktop apps
* Web apps
* Enterprise systems
* Cloud backend
* Android apps

That’s why Java is called a **general-purpose programming language**. ([Wikipedia][1])

---

# Java Environment Setup

Before writing Java programs, you need to set up your development environment.

---

## 1. Java Development Kit (JDK)

JDK includes:

* **javac** (Java compiler)
* runtime libraries
* tools to compile and run Java programs

---

## Extra Important Concepts (Added by Me ⭐)

### JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

JVM is the machine that runs Java bytecode.
It provides:

* Execution platform
* Memory management
* Security

---

### JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

JRE is used to **run** Java programs.
It includes:

* JVM
* core libraries

*Note:* JRE is enough to run apps, but not enough to develop apps.

---

### JDK vs JRE vs JVM (Quick Difference)

| Component | Work                             |
| --------- | -------------------------------- |
| JVM       | Runs bytecode                    |
| JRE       | JVM + libraries to run programs  |
| JDK       | JRE + compiler + developer tools |

---

## Basic Steps to Setup Java

1. Download and install the **JDK** for your OS
2. Verify installation using terminal/command prompt:

```bash
java -version
javac -version
```

3. Install an IDE (recommended):
   IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code

---

# Java — First Example (Hello World)

### Program Code

```java
// HelloWorld.java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

---

## Explanation

### `public class HelloWorld`

This defines a class named **HelloWorld**.
In Java, every program starts with a class.

### `public static void main(String[] args)`

This is the **main method**, which is the entry point of the program.
Java starts execution from `main()`.

### `System.out.println("Hello, world!");`

Prints output on the console:
`Hello, world!`

---

# How a Java Program Works (Step-by-Step)

Java execution happens in stages:

---

## Step 1: Write Source Code (.java)

You create a file like:

`HelloWorld.java`

---

## Step 2: Compile Source Code (javac)

Compiler converts source code into **bytecode**:

```bash
javac HelloWorld.java
```

Output file generated:

`HelloWorld.class`

---

## Step 3: Run Program (java command)

Now run bytecode using JVM:

```bash
java HelloWorld
```

---

## Step 4: JVM Executes Bytecode

JVM performs:
loads bytecode
verifies bytecode
executes it (interprets or uses JIT compilation)
manages memory + garbage collection
gives final output

Result:

Output appears on console 🎉

---

# Conclusion (Short Summary)

Java is:
Object-Oriented
Platform Independent (WORA)
Secure, Robust, and Fast
Supports multithreading
Used in real-world applications (Android, Web, Enterprise, Servers)
