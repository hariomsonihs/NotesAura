# What is Java?
Java is a **high-level, object-oriented programming language** that is widely used to build different types of software applications.
Java allows developers to write programs that are **platform-independent**.
That means:

**Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)**
Once you compile your Java program, you can run it on any system that supports Java **without rewriting the code**. 
---
### Where Java is Used?
Java is used in:

- *Desktop Application*
- *Web Applications*
- *Enterprise Applications*
- *Mobile Apps (**Android**)*
- *Server-side Applications*
- *Large Scale Systems*
### Who Developed Java?

- *Java was developed by **Sun Microsystems** *
- *Java was released in **1995***
- * **James Gosling** is known as the **Father of Java** *
- *Later, Sun Microsystems was acquired by **Oracle Corporation (2010)** *
---
# History of Java:

### Origin (1991):
Java started in **1991** as a project at Sun Microsystems, led by:

- *James Gosling*
- *Mike Sheridan*
- *Patrick Naughton*

Initially it was meant for:
embedded devices / interactive television 

### Name Journey:
Java’s project name changed over time:

1. **Oak** (named after an oak tree)
2. **Green**
3. **Java** (inspired by Java coffee)
### First Public Release

*• Java’s first public release was **Java 1.0 (1996)** *
*• It introduced the concept of:*
  **Bytecode + JVM** for platform independence.

### Oracle Takes Over (2010)
In **2010**, Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems and became responsible for Java’s development and future.

# Key Features of Java:
Java was designed with major goals such as:
portability, simplicity, robustness, security, and versatility.
---
## 1. Object-Oriented

Java is **object-oriented**, meaning it is based on:

- *Classes*
- *Objects*
- *Encapsulation*
- *Inheritance*
- *Polymorphism*

**Benefits:**

- *Code becomes modular*
- *Reusable*
- *Easy to maintain*
---
## 2. Platform Independent (Bytecode + JVM)

Java code works like this:

Java Code (.java) → compiled into **Bytecode (.class)**
Bytecode runs on **JVM** in any OS

This makes Java platform-independent and supports:

- **Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)**

---
## 3. Simple & Familiar Syntax

Java syntax is inspired from **C/C++**, but:
Java avoids complex low-level features like explicit pointers
So it is easier to learn and safer.
---
## 4. Robustness

Java is robust because it provides:

- * Strong type checking*
- *Exception handling*
- *Automatic Garbage Collection*
- *Compile-time + Runtime error checking*

This reduces common bugs like memory leaks.

---
## 5. Security

Java runs inside JVM, which provides a secure runtime environment and restrictions like:

- *Network access limitations*
- *File system restrictions*

This makes Java applications safer, especially on networks.

---
## 6. Multithreading & Concurrency

Java supports multithreading, meaning:
It can run multiple tasks simultaneously using threads.

**Example uses:**

*• Gaming*
*• Server requests handling*
*• Background processing*
*• Real-time apps*

---
## 7. Rich Standard Library (API)

Java provides huge built-in libraries for:

- *Collections (List, Set, Map)*
- *File Handling (I/O)*
- *Networking*
- *Database connectivity (JDBC)*
- *GUI tools (Swing, JavaFX)*
- *Concurrency utilities*

So developers don’t need to build everything from scratch.

---
## 8. Versatile & Dynamic

Java can be used everywhere:

- *Desktop apps*
- *Web apps*
- *Enterprise systems*
- *Cloud backend*
- *Android apps*

That’s why Java is called a **general-purpose programming language**.

---
# Java Environment Setup

Before writing Java programs, you need to set up your development environment.
---
## 1. Java Development Kit (JDK)

JDK includes:

- * **javac** (Java compiler)*
- *runtime libraries*
- *tools to compile and run Java programs*

---
## Extra Important Concepts:

### JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

JVM is the machine that runs Java bytecode.
It provides:

- *Execution platform*
- *Memory management*
- *Security*

---
### JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

JRE is used to **run** Java programs.
It includes:

- *JVM*
- *core libraries*

> *Note:* JRE is enough to run apps, but not enough to develop apps.

## Basic Steps to Setup Java

1. Download and install the **JDK** for your OS
2. Verify installation using terminal/command prompt:

```bash
java -version
javac -version
```

3. Install an IDE (recommended):
   IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code

# Java — First Example (Hello World)

### Program Code

```java
// HelloWorld.java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

---
## Explanation

```bash
public class HelloWorld
```
- This defines a class named **HelloWorld**.
- In Java, every program starts with a class.
```bash
public static void main(String[] args)
```
This is the **main method**, which is the entry point of the program.
Java starts execution from `main()`.

```bash
System.out.println("Hello, world!");
```
Prints output on the console:
`Hello, world!`

---
# How a Java Program Works (Step-by-Step)

Java execution happens in stages:
---
## Step 1: Write Source Code (.java)

You create a file like:

`HelloWorld.java`

---
## Step 2: Compile Source Code (javac)

Compiler converts source code into **bytecode**:

```bash
javac HelloWorld.java
```

Output file generated:

`HelloWorld.class`
---
## Step 3: Run Program (java command)

Now run bytecode using JVM:

```bash
java HelloWorld
```
---
## Step 4: JVM Executes Bytecode

*- JVM performs:*
*- loads bytecode*
*- verifies bytecode*
*- executes it (interprets or uses JIT compilation)*
*- manages memory + garbage collection*
*- gives final output*

*- Result:*

Output appears on console

*- Java is:*
*- Object-Oriented*
*- Platform Independent (WORA)*
*- Secure, Robust, and Fast*
