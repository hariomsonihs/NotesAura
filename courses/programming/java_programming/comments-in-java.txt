# Comments in Java

## What are Comments in Java?

**Comments** are the lines in a program that are **ignored by the Java compiler**.
They are written to **explain the code**, make it more readable, and help future developers (or yourself) understand the program easily.

Comments do not affect the output of the program.

---

## Why Do We Use Comments?

### Importance of Comments in Java

Comments are used for:

- *Explaining logic / purpose of code*
- *Making code easy to read*
- *Helping in debugging*
- *Writing documentation (especially using Javadoc)*
- *Team collaboration (others understand your code better)*

---

# Types of Comments in Java

Java supports mainly **3 types of comments**:

1. Single-line Comment (`//`)
2. Multi-line / Block Comment (`/* ... */`)
3. Documentation Comment / JavaDoc (`/** ... */`)

---

# 1) Single-line Comments
A **single-line comment** starts with `//` and continues until the **end of the line**.

---

## Syntax

```java
// This is a single-line comment
```

---

## Example Code

```java
public class SingleLineCommentExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Printing a message
        System.out.println("Hello Java!");
    }
}
```

### Explanation

> - * // Printing a message → compiler will ignore*
> - * System.out.println(...) → output will print*

---

## Single-line Comment (Inline Example)

```java
int age = 20; // age variable stores the value 20
```

This is called an **end-of-line** comment.

---

# 2) Multi-line / Block Comments
Multi-line comments are used when comment **multiple lines** me likhna ho.
They start with `/*` and end with `*/`.
---

## Syntax

```java
/*
 This is a multi-line comment
 It can span multiple lines
*/
```

---

## Example Code

```java
public class MultiLineCommentExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        /*
         This program prints 2 lines.
         Multi-line comments are useful for long descriptions.
        */

        System.out.println("Java Comments");
        System.out.println("Multi-line comment example");
    }
}
```
---

# 3) Documentation Comments (JavaDoc)
JavaDoc comment is a special type of comment used to create **professional documentation** of:

- *class*
- *method*
- *constructor*
- *variables (fields)*

It starts with `/**` and ends with `*/`.
---

## Syntax

```java
/**
This is a JavaDoc comment
 */
```
---
## JavaDoc Example (Class + Method Documentation)

```java
/**
	This class demonstrates JavaDoc comments in Java.
	Author: Hariom
 */
public class JavaDocExample {

    /**
	    Adds two numbers and returns the result.*

        @param a first number
	    @param b second number
	    @return sum of a and b

     */
    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int result = add(10, 20);
        System.out.println("Sum = " + result);
    }
}
```

## Explanation of JavaDoc Tags

> JavaDoc tags start with `@` and provide additional information.

###  Common JavaDoc Tags
---
![Javadoc Tags](https://github.com/hariomsonihs/NotesAura/blob/main/courses/programming/images/javadoc-table.jpeg)
---

## How to Generate JavaDoc

- You can generate HTML documentation using the `javadoc` tool.
- JavaDoc comments are processed to create HTML docs. 

Example command:

```bash
javadoc JavaDocExample.java
```

Output will be an HTML documentation file.

---
# Best Practices

- Always write comments that add value
- Keep comments short and meaningful
- Use JavaDoc for important methods/classes
- Avoid over-commenting (code should be readable itself)
- Update comments if logic changes

---

# Example Program Using All Types of Comments 

```java
/**
	This program demonstrates all types of comments in Java.
 */
public class AllCommentsDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Single-line comment: printing a message
        System.out.println("Hello Java Comments!");

        /*
          Multi-line comment:
          This block is used to explain multiple steps.
        */
        int a = 5;
        int b = 10;

        System.out.println("Sum = " + (a + b)); // End-of-line comment
    }
}
```
