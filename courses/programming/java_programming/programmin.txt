# Sample Exercise Content Format

This is a sample text file showing how to format your exercise content for NotesAura app.

## What is Programming

Programming is the process of writing a set of instructions that a computer can follow to perform a specific task.

**Basically**: a programmer writes code, telling the computer step-by-step what to do — like a recipe or set of directions.

### Key Points

- Programming languages are tools for communication with computers
- Code is translated to machine language (binary)
- Different languages serve different purposes

## What is a Programming Language

A programming language is a formal language — a vocabulary plus a set of grammatical (syntactic) rules — that allows humans to give instructions to a computer.

> Important: Each programming language defines its own syntax (how you write instructions) and semantics (what instructions mean).

### Popular Programming Languages

1. Java - Object-oriented, platform-independent
2. Python - Easy to learn, versatile
3. JavaScript - Web development
4. C++ - System programming, games

## Code Example

Here's a simple "Hello World" program in Java:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

## Adding Images

Bullet points:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Numbered lists:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Code Blocks

Use triple backticks for code blocks:

```

```
```

### Quotes

> Use greater-than symbol for quotes or important notes

### Horizontal Lines

Use three dashes for horizontal dividers:
