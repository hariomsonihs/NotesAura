# What is Programming?
Programming is the process of writing a set of instructions (called **code**) that a computer can follow to perform a specific task.
In simple words: **Programming = telling a computer what to do step-by-step (like a recipe).**

**Example tasks done using programming:**

*• Making mobile apps 📱*
*• Creating websites 🌐*
*• Building games 🎮*
*• Running machines/robots 🤖*
*• Solving math problems ➗*
*• Data analysis & AI 🤯*
---
## Key Points of Programming:

- Programming means writing **programs** (instructions) for computers.
- Computers do not understand human language directly.
- Code must be written in a **programming language**.
- That code is then converted into machine-understandable form (binary).

---
## What is a Computer Program?
A **computer program** is a set of instructions that tells a computer how to perform a task.

**Example:**

*• Calculator app is a program*
*• WhatsApp is a program*
*• Chrome browser is a program*
*• Your NotesAura app is a program*

# What is a Programming Language?

A **programming language** is a specially designed language used to write computer programs.
It helps humans communicate instructions to a computer in a structured way.

> Every programming language has its own **syntax (rules)** and **semantics (meaning)**.

---
## Syntax vs Semantics (Important)

### Syntax

**How code is written (rules/grammar)**
**Example:** missing `;` in C causes syntax error.

### Semantics

**What the code actually means / does**
**Example:** `a = b + 1` means add 1 to b and store in a.

## Why do we need Programming Languages?

Because computers understand only **Machine Language** (0 and 1).
So we use programming languages (like Java, Python, C) to write code easily.

---
# Types of Programming Languages

## 1) Low-Level Languages:

These are close to hardware.

- Machine language (0/1)
- Assembly language
- Fast but very hard to write.
---
## 2) High-Level Languages

These are human-friendly.
Examples:

*• C*
*• C++*
*• Java*
*• Python*
*• JavaScript*

- Easy to read, write, and maintain.

# Popular Programming Languages (with use)

1. **C** – system programming, OS, embedded
2. **C++** – games, performance apps
3. **Java** – Android apps, enterprise apps
4. **Python** – AI, ML, automation, data science
5. **JavaScript** – websites + web apps

> JavaScript is a lightweight interpreted (or JIT compiled) language widely used for web pages.

# How Programming Language Works?

When we write code in a programming language, computer cannot directly run it.
It must be converted into machine language by:

✅ **Compiler** or ✅ **Interpreter** (or both).

---
## Compiler vs Interpreter

### Compiler:
A compiler converts the whole source code into low-level machine code **at once**. ([GeeksforGeeks][5])

**Example languages:**

*• C*
*• C++*
*• Java (compile to bytecode)*
---
### Interpreter:
An interpreter reads and executes code **line-by-line**.

**Example languages:**

*• Python (mostly interpreted)*
*• JavaScript (interpreted / JIT compiled)*

# Program Execution Flow (Simple Diagram)

**Source Code** → **Compiler/Interpreter** → **Machine Code** → **CPU Executes** → **Output**

# Real-Life Example of Programming

Imagine you tell your friend:

> “Go to the kitchen → take a glass → fill water → give it to me.”

That’s a **program** ✅
Your friend is the **computer** 💻
Your steps are **instructions** 📌
That is exactly how programming works!

# Hello World Example Programs:
## C Program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello World!");
    return 0;
}
```
### Explanation

> *`#include <stdio.h>`: Allows using `printf()`*
> *`main()`: Program execution starts here*
> *`printf()`: Prints output*
> *`return 0`: Successful execution end*
---
## Java Program:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

### Explanation

> `class HelloWorld`: Defines a class
> `main()`: Starting point of program
> `System.out.println()`: Prints output to screen

# Programming Paradigms (Types of Programming Style)

**Procedural Programming**

*Example: C*

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

*Example: Java, C++*

**Functional Programming**

*Example: Haskell (also in JS/Python partially)*

**Scripting**

*Example: JavaScript, Python*
