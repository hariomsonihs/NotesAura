    "question": "What is Java?",
    "answer": "Java is a high-level, object-oriented, and platform-independent programming language.",
    "details": "Java is widely used for building mobile apps (Android), web apps, desktop apps, and enterprise software. Java follows the concept of 'Write Once, Run Anywhere' because Java code runs on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).",

    "topic": "Basics",
    "question": "Why is Java platform independent?",
    "answer": "Java is platform independent because it compiles into bytecode that runs on JVM.",
    "details": "Java compiler converts source code into bytecode (.class file). JVM on different operating systems executes the same bytecode, making Java platform independent.",

    "question": "What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?",
    "answer": "JDK is for development, JRE is for running Java apps, and JVM executes bytecode.",
    "details": "JDK (Java Development Kit) contains tools like compiler (javac). JRE (Java Runtime Environment) provides libraries and JVM to run programs. JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is responsible for executing bytecode.",

    "question": "What is the use of public static void main(String[] args) in Java?",
    "answer": "It is the entry point of a Java program.",
    "details": "public: accessible by JVM, static: no object needed to call, void: returns nothing, main: execution starts here, String[] args: stores command-line arguments.",
    "example_code": "public class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello Java!\");\n    }\n}"

    "question": "What are variables in Java?",
    "answer": "Variables are used to store data values.",
    "details": "Java variables are containers for storing values during runtime. Types include local variables, instance variables, and static variables.",
    "example_code": "int age = 20;\nString name = \"Hariom\";\ndouble salary = 25000.50;"

    "question": "What are primitive data types in Java?",
    "answer": "byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean",
    "details": "Primitive data types store simple values directly and are not objects. They occupy fixed memory sizes.",
    "example_code": "int a = 10;\ndouble d = 12.5;\nchar ch = 'A';\nboolean isJavaFun = true;"

    "question": "What is type casting in Java?",
    "answer": "Type casting converts one data type into another.",
    "details": "Type casting is of two types: Widening (implicit) and Narrowing (explicit). Widening happens automatically, while narrowing requires manual casting.",
    "example_code": "int a = 10;\ndouble b = a; // Widening\n\ndouble x = 10.99;\nint y = (int) x; // Narrowing"

    "question": "What are operators in Java?",
    "answer": "Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values.",
    "details": "Java provides arithmetic (+, -, *, /), relational (==, !=), logical (&&, ||), assignment (=), and other operators.",
    "example_code": "int a = 10, b = 5;\nSystem.out.println(a + b);\nSystem.out.println(a > b);\nSystem.out.println(a == b);"

    "question": "What is the use of if-else statement in Java?",
    "answer": "if-else is used to make decisions based on conditions.",
    "details": "if-else executes a block of code when a condition is true and another block when the condition is false.",
    "example_code": "int age = 18;\nif(age >= 18) {\n    System.out.println(\"Eligible to vote\");\n} else {\n    System.out.println(\"Not eligible\");\n}"

    "question": "What is a switch statement in Java?",
    "answer": "switch is used to execute one block of code among many options.",
    "details": "It is commonly used when there are multiple conditions based on a single variable value.",
    "example_code": "int day = 2;\nswitch(day) {\n    case 1: System.out.println(\"Monday\"); break;\n    case 2: System.out.println(\"Tuesday\"); break;\n    default: System.out.println(\"Invalid\");\n}"

    "topic": "Loops",
    "question": "What is the difference between for loop and while loop?",
    "answer": "for loop is used when the number of iterations is known, while loop is used when iterations depend on a condition.",
    "details": "for loop is compact and commonly used for fixed loops, while loop is better for indefinite loops.",
    "example_code": "// for loop\nfor(int i=1; i<=5; i++) {\n    System.out.println(i);\n}\n\n// while loop\nint j=1;\nwhile(j<=5) {\n    System.out.println(j);\n    j++;\n}"

    "question": "What is OOP in Java?",
    "answer": "OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming, a programming model based on objects.",

    "question": "What is a class in Java?",
    "answer": "A class is a blueprint for creating objects.",
    "details": "It contains fields (variables) and methods (functions) that define the behavior of objects.",
    "example_code": "class Student {\n    String name;\n    int age;\n\n    void show() {\n        System.out.println(name + \" \" + age);\n    }\n}"

    "question": "What is an object in Java?",
    "answer": "An object is an instance of a class.",
    "details": "Objects store state (data) and provide behavior (methods). They occupy memory in heap.",

    "question": "What is a constructor in Java?",
    "answer": "A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects.",
    "details": "Constructor name is same as class name and it has no return type. It is called automatically when object is created.",
    "example_code": "class Demo {\n    Demo() {\n        System.out.println(\"Constructor called\");\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Demo d = new Demo();\n    }\n}"

    "question": "What is method overloading?",
    "answer": "Method overloading means same method name with different parameters.",
    "details": "Overloading occurs in the same class. It is compile-time polymorphism because method selection happens at compile time.",
    "example_code": "class Calc {\n    int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }\n    int add(int a, int b, int c) { return a + b + c; }\n}"

    "topic": "String",
    "question": "What is the difference between == and equals() in Java?",
    "answer": "== checks reference, equals() checks content.",
    "details": "== compares memory location, while equals() compares actual value/content of objects like Strings.",
    "example_code": "String a = new String(\"Java\");\nString b = new String(\"Java\");\n\nSystem.out.println(a == b);      // false\nSystem.out.println(a.equals(b)); // true"

    "topic": "String",
    "question": "Why is String immutable in Java?",
    "answer": "String is immutable for security, performance, and thread safety.",
    "details": "String values cannot be changed after creation. Any modification creates a new object, which helps in caching and safe usage in many Java APIs.",
    "example_code": "String s = \"Hello\";\ns.concat(\" World\");\nSystem.out.println(s); // Hello (unchanged)"

    "topic": "Exception Handling",
    "question": "What is exception handling in Java?",
    "answer": "Exception handling is used to handle runtime errors gracefully.",
    "details": "Java uses try-catch-finally blocks for handling exceptions so that the program doesn't crash unexpectedly.",
    "example_code": "try {\n    int a = 10 / 0;\n} catch (ArithmeticException e) {\n    System.out.println(\"Cannot divide by zero\");\n} finally {\n    System.out.println(\"Always runs\");\n}"
